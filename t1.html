    <h2>My Projects</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Custom Instagram</strong> - Developed by the 'Drujba' team, this application allows users to share
            great photos and appreciate fellow photographers' work. As the team lead, I was responsible for coordinating
            the project, creating tasks, managing deadlines, resolving conflicts on GitHub, conducting meetings, and
            motivating and praising team members to achieve the best results. As a result, our project was unanimously
            recognized as the best in the course.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Web Interface for Neural Networks</strong> - A site for working with neural networks like VGG16,
            AlexNet, MobNet, and LeNet. In this project, I developed the user interface to facilitate the easy and
            convenient use of these models. The interface was designed to ensure that users could easily and intuitively
            interact with and experiment with the models.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Quotes Website</strong> - A site that displays and manages a collection of quotes. This is my solo
            project, which features a quotes site with implemented pagination, search functionality for quotes, and the
            ability to add new quotes and authors. It also includes registration and authentication for users.
        </li>
        <li><strong>CLI Bot</strong> - This is my individual project, implemented using object-oriented programming
            (OOP) principles and fully documented. It provides a convenient command-line interface for managing a
            contact book and generating QR codes.
        </li>
